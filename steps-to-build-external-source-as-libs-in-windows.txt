1. Download the source from official site.

2. We can configure the build settings for windows using either cmake GUI or command prompt:
	a. Using cmake gui:
		i. 		Give path to CMakeList.txt in CMake GUI.
		ii. 	Create a build dir, and set build path to that. This is the location where the Visual Studio Project files will be created.
		iii.	Then press configure button on bottom, on first attempt it will fail to generate anything and request to set the variables required.
		iv. 	Set the required variables and run configure and generate. The project files will be generated.
		v. 		Open the project solution in build dir and build it from visual studio.
		vi. 	Once the build is done, libs and dlls will be generated, you can use them directly, or install the libs in your C:/Program Files dir.
		vii. 	To install, build INSTALL.vcxproj with admin rights.
		
		
	b. Using cmd prompt:
		i. 		Create a build dir and go to that location.
		ii. 	Run the following command:
					cmake ../path-to-cmakelist -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_ONLY="s3;s3-crt;whatever-component"
		iii. 	Set the generator in above command to whatever you have available(in this case - Visual Studio 15 Win64)
		iv. 	Run the following command to build:
					"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe" ALL_BUILD.vcxproj  -p:Configuration=Release
		v. 		Again, set the path to MSBuild in above command according to your installation.
		vi. 	To install, run the following command with correct access:
					"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe" INSTALL.vcxproj -p:Configuration=Release
